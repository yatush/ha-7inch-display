* Small factor SBC
* I've tried running this with Raspberry pi 4 - it's both more expensive, heats up more, and needs more power.  The Orange Pi Zero 3 is perfect for this usage.

## (Optional) Keyboard to control the display

* There's no need while the system is "running" to control it via keyboard.
* However, for initial setup, and in case things go wrong for some reason, this is really convenient.
* Because OPI03 has only one usb pory (used for the screen), we need to also add a pin-connected USB port.
